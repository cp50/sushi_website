Sushi Business Website
Overview
This is a responsive website created for a startup sushi business, showcasing their sushi products through images and videos. The website also allows users to connect with the business owner through a 'Get in Touch' form. When a user submits the form, the owner's details are sent directly to them via a Telegram bot. The project also integrates MySQL for storing form submissions.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be mobile-friendly and adaptive to different screen sizes.
Image and Video Gallery: Users can view a gallery of images and videos showcasing the sushi products.
Get in Touch Form: A form that allows customers to contact the business. The form submissions are sent to the business owner via a Telegram bot.
Telegram Bot Integration: Form submissions trigger a Telegram bot that sends the submitted details to the owner’s Telegram on both desktop and mobile.
Database Integration: Uses MySQL to store form submission data.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP
Database: MySQL
API: Telegram Bot API
Web Server: XAMPP for local hosting
